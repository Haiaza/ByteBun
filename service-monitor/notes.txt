So im going to be making a Service Health Monitor-er & Auto-Healer
Why:  
    Practicing Sys Admin skills
    Automation + monitoring combined
    Some Kali tools

How:
 Setup "vulnerable servce"
 Make a monitoring script
 make an executable
 make a Cron Job to setup automated execution

 What i will be using to complete the Job:
  systemctl - service management
  ss - network socket inspection
  grep - analyzing the log
  version checking in the script
  cron job scheduling
  basic attack pattern recognition

Safety note : remove the test apache version after practice
sudo apt purge apache2
